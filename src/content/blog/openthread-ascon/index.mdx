## Introduction

For my [Master's Thesis](https://simeonat.github.io/research/thesis/), I modified [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/), Google's open source implementation of the [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/) commercial IoT protocol, to support the symmetric encryption algorithms defined in the [NIST endorsed](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2023/lightweight-cryptography-nist-selects-ascon) [ASCON](https://ascon.isec.tugraz.at/) cipher suite. 

My thesis mainly focused on the ***science***, showing that when the cipher built into OpenThread: AES-CCM, is replaced with ASCON AEAD, there is *no significant adverse impact* in the network performance and energy consumption of Thread devices. 

In this post, I'm going to focus on the ***engineering*** part of my thesis: how did I modify OpenThread to support ASCON-128a and ASCON-128 -- for [ESP32 Thread devices](https://openthread.io/vendors/espressif) in particular. I will discuss the changes I made, along with the challenges I encountered and how I went about solving them.

<Callout type="info">
  NIST has [standarized the ASCON cipher suite](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/08/nist-finalizes-lightweight-cryptography-standard-protect-small-devices) in August 2025. However, I completed my Master's Thesis before NIST's standardization of ASCON. Instead, I used a third-party implementation of ASCON: [LibAscon](https://github.com/TheMatjaz/LibAscon), in my thesis. LibAscon contains implementations for ASCON-128a and ASCON-128, which were defined in [version 1.2 of the ASCON specification](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-021-09398-9). Repeating my thesis research on the official [implementation](https://github.com/ascon/ascon-c) of [Ascon-AEAD128](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/232/final), NIST's standardized ASCON AEAD algorithm, is left for future work.

## Overview

For my thesis, I had to modify OpenThread so it is capable of using the ASCON AEAD algorithms on 802.15.4 compatible[^1]  ESP32 devices. 

However, I couldn't just fork and edit the [official OpenThread GitHub repository](https://github.com/openthread/openthread), since the codebase is designed to be hardware-agnostic. As a result, modifications had to be made in the source code of [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), the open source development framework that is managed by Espressif, the hardware manufacturer of ESP32s. ESP-IDF includes [Espressif's fork of OpenThread](https://github.com/espressif/openthread) as a Git submodule, and provides this fork as a dependency that can be imported into an ESP-IDF project whenever developers wish to run OpenThread on their ESP32 devices. 

Thus, I had to fork both the ESP-IDF codebase and Espressif's OpenThread fork (rather than the official OpenThread repository). My forks of [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/UCSC-ThreadAscon/esp-idf) and [Espressif's fork of OpenThread](https://github.com/UCSC-ThreadAscon/openthread) are publicly available on GitHub. Commits are always being made to ESP-IDF source code and the Espressif OpenThread fork on an often basis. I always update my forks to be up-to-date with the `main` or `master` branches of their respective upstream repositories whenever new changes are made.

The forks of ESP-IDF and the Espressif OpenThread fork collectively make up my modified version of OpenThread that can run ASCON-128a and ASCON-128 on 802.15.4 compatible ESP32 microcontrollers. In addition, my modified OpenThread implementation enables users to specify  whether ASCON-128a or ASCON-128 should be used for encryption with the use of a compiler flag.

Furthermore, the forks do not support the ability to use ASCON-80pq, as the creators of ASCON [encourage the use of ASCON-128 and ASCON-128a over ASCON-80pq](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-021-09398-9#Sec2). As a matter of fact, a [recommendation](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Events/2023/lightweight-cryptography-workshop-2023/documents/accepted-papers/03-proposals-for-standardization-of-ascon-family.pdf) has additionally been made to remove ASCON-80pq from the official, standardized version of the ASCON cipher suite that will be developed by NIST.

A really useful tool that I used in the process of replacing AES-CCM with ASCON AEAD was the [nRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer software](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Sniffer-for-802154) created by Nordic Semiconductors. The 802.15.4 packet sniffer is designed to be run on either the [nRF52840 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Sniffer-for-802154) or the [nRF52840 dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-Dongle).

The nRF52840 dongle was set up to run the nRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer such that it is able to listen to and display the packets sent between my ESP32 devices on [Wireshark](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-Dongle). Since Thread is encrypted under AES-CCM, I had to give Wireshark the Thread network key used by my ESP32 devices in order for it to be able to properly decrypt and parse the contents of in-flight packets.

## Removing AES-CCM

Before ASCON-128a and ASCON-128 could be integrated into OpenThread, AES-CCM needed to be removed. Once the ESP32 802.15.4 compatible devices were able to communicate successfully over plaintext, it was then possible to add ASCON AEAD on top of these plaintext communications.

[^1]: Thread, and hence, OpenThread, [operates on top of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and physical layer standard](https://threadgroup.org/Newsroom/PID/1804/FilterMenu/1815/FilterCategories/19). Thus, all [ESP32 devices with an 802.15.4 transceiver](https://openthread.io/vendors/espressif) are capable of running OpenThread.
