When developing on ESP32 devices running OpenThread, a key feature that I needed was the ability to set the transmission (TX) power of these devices. However, I couldn't find a tutorial or guide on how to do so. 

As a result, I wanted to write a quick guide on how you can change the TX power of ESP32 OpenThread devices, along with references to some helpful resources that helped me accomplished this task.
