The energy consumption of a device is especially important when those devices are Internet of Things (IoT) devices. ESP32 Thread devices which functions as Sleepy End Devices (SEDs) or Synchronized Sleepy End Devices (SSEDs) are no exception.

However, you cannot just simply measure the current of an ESP32 device by simply connecting it to an oscilloscope, Nordic Power Profiler Kit II, Joulescope, or your measurement device of choice. If you are not careful, you can even risk damaging the device.

To the best of my knowledge, there are not many resources that explain how to properly measure the current of ESP32 microcontrollers. 

In this guide, I would like to share what I learned in the process of measuring the energy usage of my own ESP32 devices, and common pitfalls to avoid.
